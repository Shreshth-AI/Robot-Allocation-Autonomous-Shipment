**Project Decsription:**

**Autonomous Shipment**

1️⃣ Autonomous Robot Delivery Trial – A start-up, AutonomousShipment, is testing autonomous delivery robots in Leeds. 

**The task is to:**

• Select the best robot prototype based on key performance criteria.

• Optimize robot allocation across stores while staying within a £250,000 budget.

**Analysis:**

This project focuses on testing, optimizing, and scaling autonomous robot deliveries to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer experience. Using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and TOPSIS, the "Deviant" robot was selected as the best prototype based on battery life, reliability, and cost-efficiency. A Goal Programming model determined the optimal allocation of 29 robots across various stores, ensuring £5,700 in cost savings while maximizing order fulfillment. The project demonstrates feasibility, enhances last-mile delivery, and positions autonomous logistics as a scalable, customer-centric solution for the future. 🚀📦🤖
